# Sample Interview Transcript: Following Process Definition Template

**Interviewer**: Welcome to our process documentation session. Today we're documenting a business process following our organizational template. Let's start with the basics. What is the name of the process we're discussing?

**Interviewee**: We call this the "Customer Onboarding and Verification Process" following our company naming convention.

**Interviewer**: Can you provide a description that someone unfamiliar with the process could understand?

**Interviewee**: This process handles the complete journey of bringing new customers into our system. It includes identity verification, risk assessment, account setup, and initial service activation. The goal is to ensure we comply with regulations while providing a smooth customer experience.

**Interviewer**: Who is the process owner?

**Interviewee**: The process owner is Sarah Johnson, our Head of Customer Operations. She's accountable for the entire process execution and is our escalation point for any issues.

**Interviewer**: What triggers the start of this process?

**Interviewee**: The process starts when a potential customer submits a complete application through our website, mobile app, or in-branch. This could be a new account application or service upgrade request.

**Interviewer**: How do you know the process is complete?

**Interviewee**: The process ends when the customer receives account credentials and can access our services, or alternatively, when we send a rejection notice with appeal instructions.

**Interviewer**: Who are the key players involved?

**Interviewee**: 
- **Customer Service Representatives**: Handle initial application review and customer communication
- **Compliance Team**: Performs regulatory checks and risk assessments  
- **IT Operations**: Manages system provisioning and access setup
- **Branch Managers**: Oversee in-person verifications when needed
- **Customers**: Provide required documentation and information

**Interviewer**: What tools and systems do you use?

**Interviewee**: 
- **CRM System (Salesforce)**: We track customer interactions and store documents
- **Identity Verification Platform (Jumio)**: Performs automated ID checks and biometric matching
- **Risk Assessment Engine**: Our proprietary AI system that scores customer risk profiles
- **Core Banking System**: Creates accounts and sets up initial services
- **Document Management System (SharePoint)**: Stores compliance documentation
- **Email Automation Platform**: Sends status updates and requests to customers

**Interviewer**: What data does this process handle?

**Interviewee**: We create customer profiles, read government ID documents, update risk scores, and delete temporary verification data after 30 days. The data includes personal information, financial details, ID documents, and risk assessments. Most of this is classified as "Confidential" under our data policy.

**Interviewer**: How long does this process typically take?

**Interviewee**: For straightforward cases, it takes 2-4 hours from application to account activation. Complex cases requiring manual review can take 1-3 business days.

**Interviewer**: Are there variations in this process?

**Interviewee**: Yes, we have different flows for individual customers versus business customers. There's also a simplified process for existing customers adding services, and an enhanced process for high-value customers requiring additional due diligence.

**Interviewer**: Is this process harmonized across the organization?

**Interviewee**: Yes, this process is fully standardized across all our branches and channels. We implemented the harmonized version last year.

**Interviewer**: What level of automation exists?

**Interviewee**: The process is partially automated and sufficient for our current needs. Document verification and initial risk scoring are automated, but final decisions and complex cases still require human review.

**Interviewer**: Does the process use AI?

**Interviewee**: Yes, we use AI for risk scoring and document validation. It's partially implemented and sufficient - the AI handles about 70% of cases automatically with high accuracy.

**Interviewer**: Is this process formally modeled?

**Interviewee**: Yes, it's modeled and maintained. We update the BPMN diagrams quarterly and use them for training and audit purposes.

**Interviewer**: If updates were needed, what would be the priority?

**Interviewee**: This would be priority 1 - most urgent - because it's customer-facing and regulatory compliance depends on it.

**Interviewer**: What are the main risks?

**Interviewee**: 
- **Regulatory non-compliance**: High impact, medium likelihood - could result in fines
- **Identity fraud**: Medium impact, low likelihood - fake identities getting through
- **Data breaches**: High impact, low likelihood - customer data exposure
- **System downtime**: Medium impact, medium likelihood - prevents customer onboarding

**Interviewer**: What control points are in place?

**Interviewee**: 
- **Daily compliance checks**: Automated review of all approvals
- **Monthly audit sampling**: Manual review of 5% of applications  
- **Real-time fraud monitoring**: Continuous scanning for suspicious patterns
- **Quarterly system security reviews**: Comprehensive security assessments

**Interviewer**: Have you found any issues through these controls?

**Interviewee**: Last quarter we found some documentation wasn't being stored properly in SharePoint, and we had a few cases where risk scores seemed inconsistent. Both issues have been addressed.

**Interviewer**: What recommendations have been made?

**Interviewee**: The audit team recommended implementing additional biometric checks and suggested we upgrade our risk scoring model to include more data sources.

**Interviewer**: What guidelines govern this process?

**Interviewee**: We follow KYC regulations, AML requirements, data protection laws, and our internal customer service standards. The main frameworks are ISO 27001 for security and local financial services regulations.

**Interviewer**: Are there any constraints that force specific approaches?

**Interviewee**: Yes, regulation 123.45 requires us to verify identity within 24 hours, and the Data Protection Act mandates specific consent processes. These are current legal requirements we must follow.

**Interviewer**: Any outdated constraints we should know about?

**Interviewee**: There used to be a requirement for physical document copies under the old regulation 789.12, but that was repealed last year. We could move to fully digital verification now.

**Interviewer**: What are the biggest pain points?

**Interviewee**: 
- **Manual document reviews create bottlenecks** - especially during peak periods
- **Customers get frustrated with multiple verification steps**
- **System integration issues** between our CRM and banking system cause delays
- **Inconsistent risk scoring** leads to unnecessary manual reviews

**Interviewer**: Can you walk me through the main process steps?

**Interviewee**: Certainly:
1. Customer submits application online or in-branch
2. System performs initial completeness check
3. Identity verification platform validates documents
4. Risk assessment engine scores the application  
5. Compliance team reviews high-risk cases
6. Account is created in core banking system
7. Customer receives credentials and welcome package

**Interviewer**: Are there alternative paths?

**Interviewee**: If identity verification fails, we escalate to manual review. For high-risk customers, we require additional documentation. Business customers go through an enhanced due diligence process.

**Interviewer**: How do you handle errors?

**Interviewee**: System errors trigger automatic alerts to IT. Document quality issues get sent back to customers with specific instructions. Failed identity checks go to our specialist team for manual verification.

**Interviewer**: Thank you! Is there anything else we should capture?

**Interviewee**: Just that we're planning a major system upgrade next year that should address most of our current pain points. Also, make sure to include our key terms in the glossary - KYC, AML, enhanced due diligence, and risk scoring are terms people might not understand.
